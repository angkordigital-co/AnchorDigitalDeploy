# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** When a developer pushes to main, the Next.js site is automatically built and deployed to production with zero manual intervention.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Infrastructure & Build

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Infrastructure & Build)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-01 - Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (Webhook Handler)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 0.23 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-infrastructure-build | 2/4 | 14 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (8 min), 01-02 (6 min)
- Trend: Improving

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Serverless over Docker: Cost efficiency at scale, pay only for usage
- Production-only deployments: Simplify v1 scope, preview can come later
- AWS Singapore region: Lowest latency to Cambodia users
- Web dashboard included: Needed for managing multiple sites effectively
- **Row-level security for tenant isolation:** Shared DynamoDB tables with userId GSI (01-01)
- **ON_DEMAND DynamoDB billing:** Low traffic, no benefit from provisioned (01-01)
- **90-day artifact retention:** Sufficient for rollback, prevents cost balloon (01-01)
- **Async 202 response pattern:** Webhook returns immediately, build processing via SQS (01-02)
- **timingSafeEqual for HMAC validation:** Prevents timing attacks on signature comparison (01-02)
- **Branch filter on main only:** Only process refs/heads/main pushes (01-02)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 - Architecture Decisions Required:**
- ~~Multi-tenant data isolation model~~ RESOLVED: Row-level security with userId GSI
- Lambda packaging strategy (Container Images vs Layers) affects build pipeline design
- ~~Database connection pooling strategy~~ NOT NEEDED: Using DynamoDB, no connection pooling required

**Phase 2 - Research Needed:**
- ISR cache storage strategy (S3 vs ElastiCache vs DynamoDB) for cost/latency tradeoffs
- Certificate quota management strategy for scaling to 50+ custom domains

**Phase 3 - Validation Needed:**
- OpenNext v3 compatibility with Next.js 15 features (App Router, Server Actions) needs testing
